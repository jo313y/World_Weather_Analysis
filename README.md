This was the first API call using google maps. 

### Mapping Data
It is important to know how to properly parse .json files to grab valuable information from them. Whenever you use an API, you'll need to be able to parse and clean the data. To create these maps, the user pulled data from google into a .json file. Using the specific locations within a .json file the data was grabbed and placed into a dataframe. That information in the dataframe was then used to build into Google's APIs through Maps, to build a heat map, marker map, and travel map.
